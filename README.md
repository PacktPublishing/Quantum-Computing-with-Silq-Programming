This is the code repository for [Quantum Computing with Silq Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/in/programming/quantum-computing-with-silq-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800569669), published by Packt.

**Get up and running with quantum computing with the simplicity of this new high-level programming language**

## What is this book about?
Quantum computing is a growing field, with many research projects focusing on programming quantum computers in the most efficient way possible. One of the biggest challenges faced with existing languages is that they work on low-level circuit model details and are not able to represent quantum programs accurately. Developed by researchers at ETH Zurich after analyzing languages including Q# and Qiskit, Silq is a high-level programming language that can be viewed as the C++ of quantum computers! Quantum Computing with Silq Programming helps you explore Silq and its intuitive and simple syntax to enable you to describe complex tasks with less code. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
Identify the challenges that researchers face in quantum programming
Understand quantum computing concepts and learn how to make quantum circuits
Explore Silq programming constructs and use them to create quantum programs
Use Silq to code quantum algorithms such as Grover's and Simon’s
Discover the practicalities of quantum error correction with Silq
Explore useful applications such as quantum machine learning in a practical way

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
def geometric():!?? {
    count := 0;
    ok := true;
    while ok{
        count += 1;
```
